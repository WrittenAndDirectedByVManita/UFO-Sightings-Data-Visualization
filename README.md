# UFO-Sightings-Data-Visualization

Data collected from a Kaggle dataset entitled *UFO Sightings*. This dataset was divided into two versions, complete and scrubbed. The main difference between the two is that the scrubbed version did not have any missing/incomplete reports. For the latter reason, and for the sake of simplicity, the scrubbed version of the data set was used, which even though it is smaller than the complete data set, it still covers a total of around 80 000 records. For the visualization component,the records were narrowed using only sightings from 1994 onwards and only recorded in the United States. The project was accomplished using R programming language and the Shinny Apps api platform for the visualization.
